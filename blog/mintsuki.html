  <h1>Mintsuki infrastructure things</h1>

  <p>
  Being the first blog post I've made on OS,
  even better, the first blog post I've made in general,
  this will be a fun read. I apologize in advance-
  I promise to restore any loss of cognition that occurs
  as a result of this read.
  </p>

  <p>
  Having taken a lovely, albeit sometimes confusing course on OS theory
  from my university, I decided to do it myself.
  "<a href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public">xv6</a> 
  doesn't seem too hard to write, I could do that,"
  I thought. So far, I've eaten crow, but have learned a metric crap ton
  about <a href="https://osdev.wiki/wiki/Limine">limine</a>, and
  drawing text in <a href="https://osdev.wiki/wiki/VGA_Fonts">VGA graphics mode</a>.
  If you want, you could probably skip the rest of this post
  by checking out those last two links, but I'll be going on anyway. I'll miss you!
  </p>

  <p>
  Firstly, limine, a project by <a href="https://github.com/mintsuki">mintsuki</a>,
  is a great, quick and easy way to get into long mode.
  Simply add a few requests to your kernel's C source, ensure gcc is appeased,
  linking and compiling happens, and you're basically ready to go.
  No assembly code required.
  One issue, though, is that there's not a lot of easy ways to acquire
  "bitmaps" of fonts once you're in such a deep mode.
  Protected mode has ways to program VGA registers,
  and real mode has ways to copy the BIOS stored bitmap from BIOS calls.
  </p>

  <p>
  There's a few ways around this: hardcoding bitmaps into kernel code,
  or reading from some file in a filesystem.
  Currently, I get around this using
  <a href="https://github.com/mintsuki/flanterm">flanterm</a>,
  another cool project by mintsuki.
  For now, this basically favors the hardcoding bitmap approach,
  so it should honestly be trashed ASAP in favor of something else.
  </p>

  <p>
  And that's basically it. Today president Trump got shot, ironically,
  so I'm giving it a rest for now before the world blows up.
  I'll see you all on the other side.
