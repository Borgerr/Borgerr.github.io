<body><h1>Hello</h1>
<p>
Welcome to my page. My name is Ashton, I'm a software developer passionate about
whatever "systems programming" entails these days.
Broadly, I'm a hobbyist emulator developer, operating system and kernel developer,
and CTF contestant whenever I have buddies to go with me. Otherwise, I just do wargames.
This page spells out relevant things about myself for people investigating me
in a professional sense.
</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.vivint.com/">Vivint</a> - Firmware Engineer Intern.
On Vivint's camera firmware team, I manage our build system involving technologies like
the Yocto Project, Cargo, etc. My main big task was integrating and configuring
new SDKs into our firmware in order to allow more device visibility with
<a href="https://memfault.com/">Memfault</a>.
</li>
<li>
<p>Student at the University of Utah - CompSci major,
projected to graduate Spring of 2025 with a 3.9 GPA.
During my time here, I've become close and worked as a TA for outstanding professors
like Matthew Flatt, the Godfather of <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>.
You can find projects for different classes on my
<a href="https://github.com/Borgerr/school-projects">school-projects</a>
repository. Please note, though, for academic conduct reasons,
not every cool project I did is available there.
If you want to hear about other things I did in college, like memory allocators,
web servers in C, HTTP proxies in python, and various kernels,
please do not be afraid to send me a message.

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Borgerr/rite-emu">rite-emu</a> - a CHIP-8 emulator entirely in Rust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Borgerr/bggb">bggb</a> - a Game Boy emulator. Since the Game Boy has so many moving parts, and a wide variety of games to support, this will always be a work in progress. But it currently functions quite well for what I've done with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Borgerr/apemode">apemode</a> - a POSIX shell entirely in Rust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/Borgerr/kipi">kipi</a> - a password manager.
Using rust, postgres, docker, tokio, and other things you can find in the repo.
This project was mostly for an ability to say that I've made at least one basic CRUD app
the whole way through by myself, and a small amount to
start a kind of custom SQL injection challenge.
You can see more about that challenge in the
<a href="https://github.com/Borgerr/kipi#kipi">readme</a>.

</ul>

<h3>Other stuff</h3>

<p>
I've contributed to a few open source projects, namely
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, and
<a href="https://kernel.org/">the Linux kernel</a>.
I love these projects, and no matter how minimal a change can be to still be considered
a "contribution", I love giving back to their awesome communities.
